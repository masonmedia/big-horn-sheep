			<hr>
			<p>Big Horn Sheep blend elements of funk, jazz, electronica, rock, and contemporary improvisation. The Toronto based guitar-bass-drums instrumental trio draws on influences from Rudder to Pomo, Wayne Krantz, Nerve, Tycho, and Boards of Canada. Their all-original repertoire integrates diverse stylistic interests resulting in a unique sound with lyrical melodies, electronic textures, danceable beats, and fluid improvisation. The band recently released a 4-track EP, "EPisode1", and is in preproduction for a full length album.</p>
