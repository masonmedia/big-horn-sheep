## Intro

Repo for the official website of Toronto jazz-funk-electronic band Big Horn Sheep. Big Horn Sheep blend elements of funk, jazz, EDM, rock, and contemporary improvisation. The Toronto based guitar + bass + drums instrumental trio draws on modern influences ranging from Rudder to Pomo, Wayne Krantz, Nerve, Tycho, and Boards of Canada. Their all-original repertoire written by bassist/composer Andrew Mason integrates diverse stylistic interests resulting in a unique sound with lyrical melodies, electronic textures, danceable beats, and fluid improvisation.
